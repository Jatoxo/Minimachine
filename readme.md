## Tech

Macromachine uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Flat Look and Feel] - For the nice look and feel of the UI
- [RSyntaxtextArea] - For a nicer coding experience
- [Autocomplete] - For the proper autocompletion while coding assembly

And of course Macromachine itself is open source with a [public repository][mm]
 on GitHub.
